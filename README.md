This is a simple RESTful API built using Express.js to retrieve information about countries from the restcountries.com API. The API provides endpoints to authenticate users and retrieve country information based on various filters and sorting criteria.

Getting Started
To get started with this API, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine
npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
Installation

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/NAVNEET634/assignment
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd express-country-api
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
or

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Set up environment variables:

Usage
Authentication
To authenticate and obtain an access token, send a POST request to /auth endpoint with the following JSON payload:

json
Copy code
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password"
}
If the credentials are correct, you will receive a JSON response containing the authentication token.

Endpoints
1. Fetch Detailed Information about a Country
Send a GET request to /country/:name endpoint with the name of the country as a parameter to retrieve detailed information about that country.

Example:

bash
Copy code
GET /country/United States
2. Retrieve a List of Countries
Send a GET request to /countries endpoint to retrieve a list of countries based on optional filters and sorting criteria provided as query parameters.

Example:

bash
Copy code
GET /countries?population=greaterThan=100000000&area=greaterThan=500000&sort=population&page=1&limit=10
Authentication
Authentication is required for accessing certain endpoints. You need to include an Authorization header with the value Bearer your_auth_token in your requests after obtaining the authentication token.

Error Handling
If any errors occur during API requests, appropriate error responses with status codes and error messages will be returned.
